# Emission factors sources

The emission factors used by Electricity Maps depends on the specific region.

Our default emission factors come from the [IPCC (2014) Fith Assessment Report](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-iii.pdf#page=7) report, and are fully described in our [wiki](https://github.com/electricitymaps/electricitymaps-contrib/wiki/Default-emission-factors).

For certain areas and zones (all of Europe and US, along with a few other countries), we have more specific emission factors.
The actual numbers used (as well as a link to the source) can be found in the [config/zones YAML file](https://github.com/electricitymaps/electricitymaps-contrib/tree/master/config/zones) for each specific zone.

For Europe, the methodology for calculating emission factors is detailed in our [wiki page for EU emission factors](https://github.com/electricitymaps/electricitymaps-contrib/wiki/EU-emission-factors). The same applies for [US emission factors](https://github.com/electricitymaps/electricitymaps-contrib/wiki/US-emission-factors).
