      "description": "<p>Albany wind and Grasmere farms are two wind power stations near Albany, Western Australia, owned by Bright Energy Investments. They are adjacent and are often considered a single facility. They have 18 wind turbines, with a maximum generating capacity of 35.4 MW of electricity. The original Albany Wind Farm was commissioned in October 2001, after ten years of planning. The wind farm has the capacity to produce 80 per cent of the electricity requirements of Albany.Originally commissioned in 2001 the farm was the largest of its kind in Australia.<br/>The farm originally had 12 wind turbines, with 6 extra turbines installed in 2011 as the Grasmere Wind Farm. The  original Albany Wind Farm turbines are ENERCON model E66, each with three 35 metres (115 ft) long blades made from fibreglass and kevlar (making them very flexible in order to withstand any conditions) and are fitted to 65 metres (213 ft) towers. The nose cone which the blades attach to weighs around 14 tonnes. At the time of construction these turbines were the largest installed in the southern hemisphere. The turbines operate automatically, with the three blades adjusted to make best use of power output from any wind direction or strength. They have been designed to withstand the strongest winds likely in Albany and incorporate special lightning protection. Each turbine has a rating of 1.8 MW and is able to produce electrical energy at wind speeds of 7\u2013130 kilometres per hour (4\u201370 kn) at which the turbines are shut down. Maximum output is achieved at a wind speed of 50 kilometres per hour (27 kn). The 6 new turbines installed in 2011 are ENERCON model E70 with a rating of 2.3 MW. The turbines were made in Germany.<br/>The Albany and Grasmere wind farms are situated on the coast about 12 kilometres (7 mi) south-west of the city. They are in an elevated position at approximately 80 metres (262 ft) above the Southern Ocean. The height and locality is designed to maximise exploitation of local wind conditions, and combined with the short distance to the main electricity transmission system make this an outstanding wind farm site.The farms also acts as a tourist attraction in Albany. When built A$200,000 was spent on board walks, viewing towers, interpretive displays and picnic areas on and around the site. The road to the site underwent a A$400,000 upgrade for better access for visitors. The Bibbulmun Track also traverses the site and had to be re-aligned toward the cliffs and stabilized.</p>",

As the power station&#x27;s primary role was to provide system security in the event of drought for Tasmania&#x27;s predominantly hydro-electric based generation system it only was rarely called on to operate, resulting in intervals of five to eight years between periods of significant use. After the commissioning of Basslink in 2006, the power station was decommissioned in 2009.<br/>At the time of decommissioning, it had two 120 megawatts (160,000 hp) gas fired steam turbines and three 35 megawatts (47,000 hp) gas turbines, giving a total capacity of 345 megawatts (463,000 hp) of electricity.

It is jointly owned by GDF Suez Energy AustraliaEn 72%) and Mitsui (28%).<br/>The wind farm is made up of 23 Vestas 2.0 MW wind turbines, together with an underground electrical cable network, access tracks, crane hardstandings, wind monitoring masts and a 33 kV double-circuit distribution line. Each turbine consists of a 67-metre-high (220 ft) tower and 40-metre-long (130 ft) blades, and so are 107 metres in height to the tip of the blade. These wind turbines rotate at speeds between 9 rpm and 19 rpm, depending on the wind speed. The wind yield in South Australia enables Canunda to produce electricity at a 34 per cent capacity factor, a high yield by global standards.The wind farm generates enough electricity to supply around 30,000 average South Australian homes. The Canunda Wind Farm distribution line is 16 km long and transports the generated electricity from the wind farm to a nearby substation at Snuggery. The distribution line traverses mostly roadside verges, avoiding areas of environmental sensitivity along the route. The Canunda Wind Farm provides a number of benefits to the local and wider community, including clean electricity generation, enhanced agricultural viability of the farms involved and increased diversity of electricity supply for South Australia and the south east in particular. There has also been widespread community interest in the project and site tours have commenced.The Canunda Wind Farm was opened by the Premier of South Australia, Mike Rann, on 31 March 2005. The project was completed on time and on budget and Wind Prospect provided engineering support to the owners of the wind farm, International Power, during the construction phase. Canunda Wind Farm was International Power&#x27;s first wind farm globally. It represents a diversification of the company&#x27;s energy business in Australia.</p>",

Power generated by the station supplies the south-west of Australia through the South West Interconnected System (SWIS) operated by Western Power.In the financial year of 2008/2009, the station consumed approximately 1 million tonnes (2.2 billion pounds) of coal. Carbon Monitoring for Action estimates that, in 2009, Collie Power Station emitted 2.59 million tonnes (5.7 billion pounds) of CO2 to generate 2.3 terawatt-hours (8.3 petajoules) of electricity.In household consumer terms, this equates to 1.13 kilograms (2.5 lb) of CO2 emitted for each one kilowatt-hour (kWh), or 3.6 megajoules, of electricity produced and fed into the electricity grid. That is, Collie Power Station emits slightly less CO2 per kilowatt-hour of electricity produced than nearby closing Muja Power Station (1.14 kilograms or 2.5 pounds) but more than also nearby Bluewaters Power Station (0.825 kilograms or 1.82 pounds) based on estimates for the same year.</p>",

The station is located 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) east of Miles on the south side of the Warrego Highway.  The Condamine Power Station is owned by QGC Limited, a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell. It has been claimed to be the world\u2019s first combined-cycle power station entirely fired by untreated coal seam gas and Australia&#x27;s first steam turbine condenser cooled by coal seam methane waste water. However, the Townsville Power Station at Yabulu, which was converted from a peak load power station to burn only coal seam gas in a combined cycle configuration, was commissioned much earlier, in February 2005.<br/>Construction began on 19 October 2007. It was completed in mid-2010.  The EPC contractor was Austrian Energy and Environment with the gas turbines supplied by Siemens. Parsons Brinckerhoff were the owner&#x27;s engineer for construction.  The gas turbine with dispatchable unit ID (DUID) &quot;CPSA&quot; began bidding into the National Electricity Market on 1 June 2009, with the first generation made available to the market on 10 July 2009. The Columboola Switching Station, which connects Condamine Power Station with the Chinchilla-to-Roma 132-kilovolt<br/>transmission line, was completed in October 2008.<br/>AGL Energy had an option to acquire the Condamine Power Station. This option was not exercised and expired on 14 April 2009.The power station has installed capacity of 140 MW.  <br/>Electricity is generated by two gas turbines and one steam turbine from coal seam gas. The two gas turbines are Siemens SGT-800 models and the steam turbine is a Siemens SST-400. According to the NEMMCO Applicants list, the registered capacity of the gas turbine is 87.4 MW (2 x 43.7 MW) and the registered capacity of the steam turbine is 57.1 MW.The gas reserves are extracted from the Berwyndale South Gasfield. Building the plant directly on top of the gas source will provide some of the cheapest gas-fired electricity to the National Electricity Market.</p>",

Dalrymple substation is at the end of a 275 kV power line into the peninsula. It feeds 33 kV lines to various towns across the lower end of the peninsula and receives electricity generated by the Wattle Point Wind Farm.<br/>The facility is able to store excess generation from Wattle Point Wind Farm as well as a colocated solar farm and is expected to provide a similar service to the Hornsdale Power Reserve in the Mid North of the state.The battery was constructed by Consolidated Power Projects with ABB and Samsung components. It was part-funded by a grant from the Commonwealth Government through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA). It was commissioned in June and July 2018. It provides frequency control to the grid, and also enables the possibility for Yorke Peninsula to operate independently of the wider grid in the event of a system failure.</p>",

The drive trains and hubs were assembled at the former Ford Australia site in Geelong.The wind farm is the largest in Victoria, soon to be overtaken by Stockyard Hill. It has contracts to supply 37% of its output to the government of Victoria and 50% to Snowy Hydro. It is being developed by Tilt Renewables. The wind farm connects to the grid via 38 kilometres of 220kV overhead transmission line to a substation near the Mortlake Power Station.A 327 tonne transformer transported at night took four nights to reach Dundonnell from Glen Waverley in eastern Melbourne in August 2019. It was manufactured there by the Wilson Transformer Company. The developer spent $80 million to connect the wind farm to the main 500 kV grid via a 38 km 220 kV Ausnet line, avoiding the connection problems many other generating stations have in the interior. Full commissioning was delayed in mid-2020 due to concerns of the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), despite it being commissioned according to a plan negotiated with AEMO in 2018.</p>",

To balance that and achieve better utilisation of transmission infrastructure, APA installed a 20MW solar farm on an adjacent site. The solar farm&#x27;s peak output is during the time when the wind farm is not at full capacity, so no additional capacity was needed in the substation or grid connection point. The solar farm has 75,000 photovoltaic solar panels on a 70-hectare site east of the wind farm. It cost A$50 million (including a federal government grant of A$5.5 million) and began operation in December 2017.

Wind turbines in the farm are visible from the Hume Highway. <br/>The Gunning Wind Farm comprises an electrical substation and operation and maintenance facilities plus 31 turbines which send power to the substation via 17km of underground cabling.<br/>A 14km-long 132kV transmission line was constructed to connect the wind farm to the 132kV Yass-Goulburn transmission line. Turbines generate electricity at 12kV which travels via underground cables to the substation where it is stepped up to 132kV to match the grid voltage.<br/>Construction began in April 2010 and created about 100 jobs, bringing significant economic activity to the Gunning region. The wind farm was completed in May 2011.<br/>A great deal of work was done prior to development of the wind farm. Technical studies identified constraints and the best design, with independent consultants engaged to report on:<br/><br/>flora and fauna<br/>cultural heritage<br/>traffic and transport<br/>geology and hydrology<br/>landscape and visual amenity<br/>soundThe wind farm is capable of producing 46.5MW of clean, renewable energy.<br/>Each of the 1.5MW turbines at the Gunning Wind Farm can provide sufficient renewable energy to power approximately 750 homes and save more than 5,250 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions a year.<br/>The 31 turbines can power 35,000 homes annually and save more than 162,750 tonnes of greenhouse gases a year.<br/>ACCIONA Energy [1] has established a Community Benefit Fund to deliver tangible benefits to the local community. This initiative will run for the life of the project (25 years).<br/>The Fund support services, events and projects which directly and indirectly benefit the community in the vicinity. <br/>ACCIONA Energy also provides sponsorship support to local groups and events.</p>",

Hazelwood emitted 14% of Victoria&#x27;s annual greenhouse gas emissions and 3% of Australia&#x27;s greenhouse gas emissions.<br/>International Power plc purchased Hazelwood Power Station and the adjoining mine from the Victorian Government in 1996 with an expected 40-year life. In 2005, the Bracks Labor Government approved an environmental effects statement (EES) that allowed Hazelwood to relocate a road and a section of the Morwell river to allow access to an additional 43 million tonnes of coal in addition to that allowed under the mining licence boundaries set at the time of privatisation. This was estimated to provide sufficient coal for the plant to operate to at least 2030 (prior to decommissioning plans). The EES also capped its expected total greenhouse output at 445 million tonnes of carbon dioxide over its life, after which Hazelwood may have been made to cease operation.<br/>Hazelwood was jointly owned by Engie (formerly GDF Suez), with a 72% share and Mitsui &amp; Co. with a 28% share. In 2014, Hazelwood employed 495 staff directly and on average 300 contractors. On 3 November 2016, Engie announced that the entire Hazelwood plant would be closed at the end of March 2017 giving five months notice of the closure. The power station closed in March 2017.</p>",

The location of the project is Leonards Hill, 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) south of Daylesford, Victoria, north-west of Melbourne, Victoria.  It comprises two individual 2.05 MW wind turbines supplied by REpower System AG which are projected to produce enough energy for 2,300 households, almost as many houses are in the twin-towns of Daylesford and Hepburn Springs.The project is the first community-owned wind farm in Australia. The initiative emerged because the community felt that the state and federal governments were not doing enough to address climate change. Hepburn Wind is the first project of the Hepburn Renewable Energy Association, now known as SHARE.<br/>Hepburn Wind Project formally launched their share offer on 25 July 2008, and as of June 2011 over 1700 members had subscribed a total of $9.0 million. The project has secured over $13.1 million in funding with the additional funds being bank debt and Government grants. Shares have been issued with priority to the local residents of Daylesford and Hepburn Springs.<br/>As the project is under 30 MW, it was assessed under the local planning guidelines administered through the Hepburn Shire Council. The planning permit was issued by Hepburn Shire in February 2007. The council received 325 submissions in support of the proposal and 18 objections.<br/>The permit was subsequently challenged unsuccessfully at the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) in June 2007.On 28 April 2010 the project signed a contract with REpower Systems for the turnkey construction of the wind farm. The official ground breaking ceremony was held on 8 October 2010 and was officiated by the Hon Gavin Jennings, the Victorian Minister for the Environment at the time.<br/>Construction began in November 2010. The turbines left Germany on 5 December 2010 on the SE Panthea and arrived in Melbourne on 22 February 2011.<br/>A community picnic day was held to view and celebrate the erection of the first turbine on Saturday, 19 April 2011.<br/>The wind farm began generating power into the local electricity network on Wednesday, 22 June 2011.Community-owned wind farms are common in Denmark and Germany, which have high levels of wind power use. Community wind projects are also emerging in Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>",

The power station is owned by CleanCo Queensland.<br/>Taking its name from the Aboriginal word meaning &#x27;big water&#x27;, the Kareeya Hydro project originally comprised construction of Koombooloomba Dam, the Tully Falls Weir and Kareeya Hydro power station. A dam was needed for water storage because most of the rain in the area falls in the first few months of the year. An intake tower is located in the weir, which directs water down a tunnel to the turbines in an underground power station below Tully Falls.<br/>Planning for the project began in 1949 and it was intended to be operating by 1955. Construction of a diversion tunnel started in early 1952. The 132 Kv transmission line was the first ever constructed in Queensland and the state&#x27;s first use of steel towers for electricity distribution. The last of the four generating sets was installed by mid-1959.<br/>The power station&#x27;s staff and families were provided accommodation in a small village, named Cardstone, located downstream from the plant.</p>",

The consideration of the site as being appropriate as a power station site was being considered in the early 2000s.It is rated at 300 MW using two Siemens open cycle gas turbine generators powered by natural gas. It operates as a peaking plant and provides electricity into the South West Interconnected System (SWIS). When it was built in 2005, it was rated at 260.9 MW, and received an upgrade to the current capacity in June 2008. When gas is not available, the power station can also operate on fuel oil. Gas is supplied to the Kemerton Power Station via a 4.94 km lateral branch from the Dampier to Bunbury Natural Gas Pipeline. The branch line is a 300 mm diameter steel pipe with 6.4 mm wall thickness.Kemerton power station also has four 1.25 MW diesel generators completed in October 2018. These are used in a contract with the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) to provide the capability for a black start on the SWIS if needed.</p>",

It is situated in Laverton North, on the south-western outskirts of Melbourne, Victoria, approximately 15 km from the Melbourne Central Business District. It is a peaking power plant, particularly constructed to cater for the growth in Victoria&#x27;s summer electricity demand, and can be rapidly activated when required.The station has two open-cycle gas turbines that together can generate a total of 320 MW of electricity. The turbines are primarily fuelled by natural gas supplied from the Brooklyn-Lara gas pipeline but, in the event of a gas supply curtailment, they can burn low sulphur emission heavy oil as a backup fuel. The plant is normally operated remotely from Snowy Hydro Limited&#x27;s central control room in Cooma, New South Wales, but is also equipped to be run locally.Snowy Hydro contracted Siemens to complete the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) for the project. Initial civil works started in October 2004 and the station was commissioned in December 2006.The original licence only allowed the power station to operate for 10% of the year, but in May 2007 Snowy Hydro applied for an emergency extension of operating hours because a drought had affected hydro energy supplies. The Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal issued an interim order that the plant remain shut down on weekdays between 8am to 5pm, due to neighbouring offices being affected by the level of noise and vibration. However, the order was lifted in July 2007.</p>",

The power station was commissioned in 2002 and cost $1.5 billion to build.  The power station is owned and operated by InterGen, a multinational company owned by the Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan and AIG Highstar Capital II, a private equity fund sponsored by a subsidiary of American International Group, Inc.The plant takes advantage of the abundant deposits of bituminous coal from the Surat Basin. Fuel is transported via conveyor belt from the open-cut Commodore Mine.Water is supplied via pipeline from the Wetalla sewage treatment plant in Toowoomba. The 850 MW plant uses air cooling technology to reduce water consumption. In 2002, when the plant became operational, wholesale prices for electricity fell by about one third to $20/MWh. This was due to the market strategy to bid at short run marginal cost - so with high efficiency plant and cheap coal, this had a significant impact on the market.<br/>Millmerran Power Station which won the Banksia Environmental Award 2006 in the water category, supplies enough electricity to power approximately 1.1 million homes by selling all its electricity into the National Electricity Market (NEM).Carbon Monitoring for Action estimates this power station emits 5.75 million tonnes of greenhouse gases each year as a result of burning coal. The Australian Government has announced the introduction of a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme commencing in 2010 to help combat climate change. It is expected to impact on emissions from power stations. The National Pollutant Inventory provides details of other pollutant emissions, but, as at 23 November 2008, not CO2.</p>",

It was coal powered with four 60 MW steam turbines that generated a total of 240 MW of electricity. Playford B received coal by rail from the Leigh Creek Coal Mine, 280 km to the north and drew cooling water from Spencer Gulf, returning it to the sea at an elevated temperature. Commissioned in 1963, it was co-located with the older Playford A Power Station and the larger, newer Northern Power Station. Playford B was mothballed in 2012 and its permanent closure was announced by operator Alinta Energy in October 2015. Prior to being mothballed it primarily operated in the summer, when electricity demand peaks.</p>",

To begin, the transmission line needed to connect the fully developed wind farm would need to be as long as 300 km, and due to multiple connection options, as well as an expected large cost of the infrastructure, the decision of the final solution was delayed.In 2012, the start-date for construction of the wind farm has been pushed back to 2014, after AGL Energy decided to give priority to building two solar photovoltaic plants which have received almost A$200m in government funding.The project&#x27;s planning approval was set to expire on 24 May 2016, however AGL submitted a Modification Application on 25 February 2016 with the sole aim to extend the project&#x27;s Planning Approval expiry to 2021. On 3 June 2016 that application was granted, giving AGL the option to optimise and build the project within their Powering Australian Renewables Fund. The project secured a Power Purchase Agreement with EnergyAustralia for supply of 60% of its annual output until December 2030.On 16 May 2017, AGL announced construction had commenced.As of 2019, it had been completed and is now operating.

They were bought by the Government of South Australia in 2017 as a response to the 2016 South Australian blackout and load-shedding in February 2017.<br/>Temporary Generation North is five open cycle gas turbines installed at the former Holden site in Elizabeth South, a northern suburb of Adelaide.The generators were purchased to be used only in emergency shortfalls in electricity supply to the grid, such as in extreme weather. Both sets were first used on 24 January 2019 to deal with a supply shortfall in Victoria.The intent of the Weatherill ALP state government was that the turbines would be converted from diesel fuel to natural gas and moved to a single location while remaining owned by the government.In August 2019, the state government (following the 2018 election, now controlled by the Liberal party) announced that it had arranged 25-year leases of the power stations to two different companies, with the leases taking effect from May 2020. Both companies operate wind farms in South Australia. The five northern generators will be leased to Nexif Energy and relocated to a new site at Outer Harbor and operating on natural gas before the end of 2020. Nexif Energy also proposes to convert them to combined cycle with a steam turbine in the following few years.</p>",

They were bought by the Government of South Australia in 2017 as a response to the 2016 South Australian blackout and load-shedding in February 2017.<br/>Temporary Generation South is four open cycle gas turbines at the former Port Stanvac Refinery at Lonsdale.The generators were purchased to be used only in emergency shortfalls in electricity supply to the grid, such as in extreme hot weather. They were first used on 24 January 2019 to deal with a supply shortfall in Victoria.The intent of the Weatherill ALP state government was that the turbines will be converted from diesel fuel to natural gas and moved to a single location while remaining owned by the government.In August 2019, the state government (following the 2018 election, now controlled by the Liberal party) announced that it had arranged 25-year leases of the power stations to two different companies, with the leases taking effect from May 2020. Both companies operate wind farms in South Australia. The four generators at Lonsdale will be leased to Infigen Energy and will be moved from the SA Water desalination plant to the SA Water Bolivar Waste Water Treatment Plant and converted to operate on natural gas instead of diesel.</p>",

Due to dwindling demand, the first of the two generating units had been mothballed in January 2013, and the second in April 2014. In November 2014, EnergyAustralia announced that it would permanently close Wallerawang due to ongoing reduced energy demand, lack of access to competitively priced coal and the power station\u2019s high operating costs.

      "description": "<p>Wattle Point Wind Farm is a wind farm near Edithburgh on the Yorke Peninsula in South Australia, which has been operating since April 2005. When it was officially opened in June of that year it was Australia&#x27;s largest wind farm at 91 megawatts (122,000 hp). The installation consists of 55 wind turbines covering 17.5 square kilometres (6.8 sq mi)and was built at a cost of 180 million Australian dollars. It is connected to ETSA Utilities electricity transmission system via a 132 kilovolt line.The location was chosen after identification as having one of mainland Australia&#x27;s highest average wind speeds. The wind farm was officially opened by South Australian Premier Mike Rann and Southern Hydro Chairman, Dr Keith Turner. The opening was opposed by some of the local Indigenous Australians, the Adjahdura (or Narungga). A descendant of the traditional landowners argued that construction desecrated an ancient burial ground, disturbing skeletons in the construction of turbine number four. Work was halted in late 2004 after the discovery of human remains, artefacts and tools. The Aboriginal Affairs Department, and the developers, separately commissioned archaeological reports resulting in the development allowed to proceed with five towers being repositioned. Both reports concluded that the bones had come from elsewhere on the peninsula, being later reburied at Wattle Point. The region&#x27;s aboriginal community was divided on construction; Narungga National Aboriginal Corporation supporting development and the Narungga Heritage Committee strongly opposing.Wattle Point Wind Farm was built and owned by Southern Hydro Pty Limited. Southern Hydro was owned by Meridian Energy of New Zealand until October 2005, when it was bought by the Australian Gas Light Company (AGL). The windfarm was acquired by Alinta in October 2006, as part of an asset merger with AGL, and subsequently by the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group&#x27;s Energy Infrastructure Trust, for 225 million dollars on 23 April 2007.<br/><br/>The District Council of Yorke Peninsula approved a second wind farm, Wattle Point Stage 2. However it did not proceed due to insufficient capacity in the electrical transmission lines.The facility is closely connected to the Dalrymple ESCRI battery, a 30-megawatt battery storage facility at Dalrymple substation about 21 kilometres (13 mi) to the north.</p>",

The total installed capacity is 192 MW.The green energy generated by the wind farm each year provides electricity for 143,000 households enough to power a city 3-4 times the size of Ballarat.Acciona Energy formed a Community Reference Group (CRG) for the construction phase of the Waubra wind farm, to provide a regular forum for community input to the project and to facilitate communication between members of the Waubra community and the wind farm project team. In 2010 the anti-wind farm lobby group the Waubra Foundation adopted the name of the nearby town.<br/>The construction of the Waubra wind farm received financial assistance as part of the Victorian State Government\u2019s Victorian Renewable Energy Target (VRET).In July 2011 the Australian Broadcasting Corporation 4 Corners program explored health concerns connected with Australian wind farms in its &quot;Against the Wind&quot; report.

      "description": "<p>Yarrawonga Power Station is adjacent to the original weir structure on Lake Mulwala, on the Murray River, on the south side of the Victorian/NSW border. Yarrawonga Power Station was completed in 1994 and is a run-of-river scheme using a Kaplan-type turbine. The station has two ESAC variable pitch Kaplan turbo-alternators, each with a capacity of 4.75 MW, and feeds power into the Victorian transmission grid at a voltage of 22 kV. Despite the power station&#x27;s presence, Lake Mulwala is kept at a reasonably constant level for recreational purposes. Changes in the head are driven by changes in the height of the Murray River. These changes are directly related to precipitation in the catchment areas and water releases from the Hume Dam.<br/><br/>Upstream storage control at Lake Hume and Dartmouth allows consistent storage levels at Lake Mulwala. This permits Yarrawonga Power Station to be a relatively consistent power producer.</p>",
